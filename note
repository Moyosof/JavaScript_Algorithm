            What is an Algorithm?
 Its a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem
            Practical Example is how to make a noodle 
 Ingredent ---- Steps ----- Tasty noodles.

            Alg to add two numbers
 Inputs           -----  Algorithm          -----          Output
 {two num "a" and "b"}   {Add numbers using "+    {Sum of "a" and "b"}
                           return the value "}

                           
We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its INPUT SIZE
#TIME COMPLEXITY:- Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as func of input size
#SPACE COMPLEXITY:- Amount of memory taken by an alg to run, as a func of input size.

     HOW TO REPRESENT COMPLEXITY
#BIG-O NOTATION - Worst  case complexity
#OMEGA NOTATION - Best case
#THETA NOTATION - Average case
